## Skills

#### Leadership Resource Planning
As Development Lead at Switchboard, I am responsible for the creation and implementation of the charity’s fundraising strategy. Starting from scratch, my focus was to build a sustainable infrastructure for income generation which included implementing a CRM (Donorfy), collating 5 years of financial data to understand Switchboard’s income distribution, creating best practice for team members when engaging with the CRM and mapping the “donor journey”.

#### Management 
In my previous role as Lead Transaction Advisor at Litera, a legal tech company, I was part of a small team that created an entirely new revenue stream for the organisation. As the product gained popularity, I managed a team of Transaction Advisors who worked closely with internal and external teams to understand our clients’ key pain points, coordinated events to break into a seemingly impenetrable industry averse to risk and presented pitches and demos daily to key stakeholders in the legal industry.

#### Presentation
As Development Lead, I created 3 core workshops true to Switchboard’s identity which include; allyship using our volunteers active listening skills, current caller themes pulled from Twillio (mental health, gender identity, hate crimes) and LGBTQ+ history through the lens of Switchboard’s log books from 1974 to present day (using historical archives from the Bishopgate Institute). This Pride season, I even had one attendee tell me that my presentation had given them the confidence to come out as genderqueer at work! This was an immensely powerful reminder that these workshops are an invaluable opportunity to increase an organisation’s awareness of the struggles faced by LGBTQ+ communities and provide an informed platform for further discussion in sometimes immensely exclusionary professional environments.
